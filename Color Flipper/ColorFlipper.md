# Color Flipper with JS

So for this project in orer to learn how to access properties within the DOM model using js we have set up a button using basic html and css
that uses an onClick function in order to randomise the text within background property of the html body tags by calling the javascript Math.floor() function.

This generates a random number and converts it to string to be readable in the css properties and is concantated to an existing # string in order to equate 
to a hex value, resulting a simple web page that randomises the background colour and then ourputs this hex value to a heading tag incase the individual wishes 
to store the value for later use.
